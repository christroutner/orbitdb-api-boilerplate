# orbitdb-api-boilerplate
Forked from an early version of [tor-list-api](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/tor-list-api). This is a 'boilerplate' which is intended to be used to start new projects. It creates a REST API server with a POST endpoint for writing to an OrbitDB, and a GET endpoint for retrieving entries from the OrbitDB.
